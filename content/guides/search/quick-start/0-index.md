# Search content using metadata

The Box Metadata Query API enables the programmatic search of Box content by
applied metadata. The structure of a metadata search query is similar to that of
a SQL query and allows for Boolean operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, as well
as comparison or range operators, such as equal to, greater-than, and less-than.
