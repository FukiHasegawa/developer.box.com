## Download configuration file

The CLI needs to be configured to point to a configuration file so that it can
[authenticate][auth] and then make API calls as the authenticated user. By
default the CLI will always authenticate as the JWT applicationâ€™s
[Service Account][sa].

To download the configuration file, visit the configuration tab in the 
[Developer Console][dc] for the JWT application created in step 1. 
Click **Generate a Public/Private Keypair**, which will automatically start the
download. 

<Message warning>
   For security reasons 2FA must be enabled on your Box account to successfully
   generate a public/private keypair.

## Rename and move configuration file

Locate the downloaded file on your machine which has a default name in the
format: `EnterpriseID_publicKeyID_config.json`. You may leave this name or
choose to rename it. This guide assumes the file is renamed to `config.json`. 

<Message warning>
   It is critical you place the file to a location where it will not be
   inadvertently deleted or moved. If this occurs you will need to repeat the
   steps below to reconfigure the CLI to point to the file.

## Run configuration command

Then, open the terminal or command line and type the command: 

`box configure:environments:add PathToConfigFileHere`

For example: 
`box configure:environments:add /Users/ExampleUser/Documents/CLI/config.json`

<Message type=tip>
   You can drag the file from your machine to the terminal/command line window
   to auto-populate the path for you.
