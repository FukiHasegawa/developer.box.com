# Delete Collaboration Whitelist

Deleting a collaboration whitelist entry will remove the ability for
collaborations to be created between your enterprise and the domain listed in
that whitelist.

To delete a collaboration whitelist, supply the domain whitelist entry ID to
the delete request, which is returned when [creating a new whitelist entry][create]
or [listing whitelists in the enterprise][list];
