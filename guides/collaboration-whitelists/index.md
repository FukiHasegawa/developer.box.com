# Collaboration Whitelists

Within the content and sharing settings for an enterprise, an admin can specify
[collaboration restrictions][collab-restrictions] for the enterprise. These
settings include the ability to limit collaborations to only a series of
whitelisted domains.

The collaboration whitelist APIs are available to allow applications with
appropriate permissions to add, fetch, and delete these whitelisted domains
programmatically for the enterprise.
