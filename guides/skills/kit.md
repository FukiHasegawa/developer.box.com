# Box Skills Kit

The Box Skills Kit is a Node wrapper that is designed to abstract many of the
common complex operations required during the Box Skills development process.

These complex operation abstractions include:

* Interpreting and extracting relevant data from the notification payload sent
from Box.
* Making authenticated calls using the downscoped tokens in the
[Skills event payload](guide://skills/handle/payload) to download the file
stored in Box.
* Simplifying the operations around storing metadata back to the file stored in
Box.

For a complete overview of the Node Box Skills kit, see the
[GitHub documentation][github-skills-kit].
